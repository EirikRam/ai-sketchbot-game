🎮 GUESS THE SKETCH – GAME RULES 🎨

🧠 OBJECTIVE:
Draw the object shown in the sketch prompt and see if the AI can guess it correctly. It's you vs. the AI — how well can you sketch, and how smart is the AI?

📜 HOW TO PLAY:
1. Click the green "Start Challenge" button.
2. A new prompt will appear (e.g., “🎯 Draw: airplane”).
3. Use your mouse to draw the object on the canvas.
4. Click the "🤖 Predict" button once you’re done.
5. The AI will analyze your sketch and try to guess it.
6. You gain 1️⃣ point for each correct guess.
7. 3 incorrect guesses = ❌ Game Over!

🔄 CONTROLS:
- 🎮 Start Challenge – Get a new drawing prompt.
- 🧹 Clear – Erase the canvas and try again.
- 🤖 Predict – Let the AI make its guess.
- 🎨 What can I draw? – Toggle to view the full list of recognizable classes.

⚠️ STRIKES:
- Each incorrect prediction counts as a ❌ strike.

Reach the highest streak you can before 3 strikes!

💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS:
