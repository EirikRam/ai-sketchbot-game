Absolutely — thank you for the clarification. I now clearly understand your new game vision, and I’ll summarize everything in detail below to ensure we're 100% aligned.

## ✅ NEW GAME VISION: **"Team Up with the Robot" (Co-op Pictionary with AI)**

---

### 🎯 **Objective**

You are **not competing** against the AI — you are **on the same team**.

* You draw.
* The AI (robot) guesses what you drew.
* If the AI guesses right: 🟢 **Point for the team**.
* If the AI guesses wrong: 🔴 **Strike against the team**.
* 3 strikes = ❌ **Game Over**.
* The goal is to **build the longest streak** (highest score) without hitting 3 wrong guesses.

### 🧩 **Game Flow / Rules**

| Step              | Description                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. 🧠 Prompt      | You’re shown a prompt (e.g., “Draw a bicycle”).                  |
| 2. 🎨 Draw        | You draw on the canvas.                                          |
| 3. 🤖 AI Guesses  | The AI tries to guess what the drawing is.                       |
| 4. ✅ If Correct   | Score goes up by 1. Robot reacts positively. Move to next round. |
| 5. ❌ If Incorrect | Add a strike. Robot reacts sadly. If 3 strikes → Game Over.      |
| 6. 🏆 End Game    | When game ends, user enters a nickname to save their score.      |
| 7. 🏅 High Scores | Optionally view leaderboard of top streaks.                      |

### 📊 **Game Stats Tracked**

* `score` → Total number of correct AI guesses.
* `strikes` → How many incorrect guesses (0–3).
* `highScores[]` → Local/remote storage of nickname + score.

### 🔧 Implementation Tasks

1. [ ] **Game Mode Rewrite**: Switch from player vs AI to team play logic.
2. [ ] **Score + Strike Counter**: Add UI + variables for team score and strikes.
3. [ ] **Win/Lose Round Logic**: Update logic so robot’s guess determines point or strike.
4. [ ] **Game Over Condition**: Trigger modal on 3 strikes.
5. [ ] **Nickname + Score Save**: Create UI + logic to enter/save score.
6. [ ] **Optional Leaderboard**: Store/display past scores.
7. [ ] **Robot Reactions**: Show happy or sad based on AI success.
8. [ ] **Visual Feedback**: Display heart icons (lives) and score visibly.

### 🧠 Example UI Messages

* "Prompt: Draw a **bicycle**. Help the robot guess!"
* AI guessed: **Bicycle** ✅ → “Great job! You and the robot earned a point!”
* AI guessed: **Toothbrush** ❌ → “Oops! That’s a strike. Try again!”
* “You’ve got 2 strikes. One more and it’s game over!”
* Final message: “Game Over – Your score: 7. Enter your name to save it!”

### ✅ Confirm Before We Build

Let me know if this breakdown is:

* ✅ Exactly what you had in mind
* 🛠️ Needs adjustments
* 🔁 Should include/exclude anything

Once confirmed, we’ll move forward **step by step**, starting with the core logic changes (score, strikes, and updated AI guessing feedback).
